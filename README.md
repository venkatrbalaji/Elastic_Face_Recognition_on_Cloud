This code snippet plays a critical role in the parent repository's architecture by enabling face detection functionality.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [training.py](https://github.com/venkatrbalaji/Elastic_Face_Recognition_on_Cloud/blob/master/models/utils/training.py)                     | The code snippet in `training.py` file implements various utility functions for training or evaluating a PyTorch model. It includes a Logger for tracking and printing progress, a BatchTimer for measuring time or rate per batch/sample, an accuracy calculation function, and a pass_epoch function for training or evaluating the model over a data epoch. These functions are essential for managing and monitoring the training process in the Elastic_Face_Recognition_on_Cloud repository. |
